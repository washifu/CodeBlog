## [Find the Point](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-point/problem) -- (Easy)

### Description:
Consider two points,  and . We consider the inversion or point reflection, , of point  across point  to be a  rotation of point  around .

Given  sets of points  and , find  for each pair of points and print two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and  on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of sets of points. 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains four space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , , and  defining points  and .

Constraints

Output Format

For each pair of points  and , print the corresponding respective values of  and  as two space-separated integers on a new line.

Sample Input

2
0 0 1 1
1 1 2 2
Sample Output

2 2
3 3
Explanation

The graphs below depict points , , and  for the  points given as Sample Input:
